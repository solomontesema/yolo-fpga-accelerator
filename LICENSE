YOLOv2 Implementation
================================================================================

The YOLOv2 implementation in this repository is based on the Darknet framework
and YOLOv2 algorithm by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi.

Original Darknet: https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet
YOLOv2 Paper: "YOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger"

The Darknet framework and YOLOv2 implementation are in the Public Domain.
